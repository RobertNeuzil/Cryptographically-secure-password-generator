# Cryptographically-secure-password-generator
I was tired of web browser password generators. I didn't want to use an online password generator that records your IP address. For obvious reasons, that seems like a security risk.
So I created a python script that will run all the most important password requirements for the user to choose on a cmd line. This password generator is cryptographically secure.
