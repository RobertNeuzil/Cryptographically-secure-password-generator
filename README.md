# Cryptographically-secure-password-generator
I was tired of web browser password generators. Half the time, they don't even present the option to create a new password in the html input field on the website. You would think it wouldn't be hard for a web browser to read for a <input type='password"> and present users an option to run their password generator. Alas, many web browsers fall short. 
I didn't want to use an online password generator that records your IP address. 
For obvious reasons, that seems like a security risk.
So I created a python script that will run all the most important password requirements for the user to choose on a cmd line. This password generator is cryptographically secure.
